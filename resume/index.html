		<p>I love building things. building things with lego bricks has been a thing for me since I was a child. I love drawing, so it is not uncommon to hear my mum shouting "stop drawing on the walls at home" or my teacher saying "next time maybe double-check your answers instead of scribbling on the back of the exam paper if you have extra time".</p>
		<p>I love playing video games since I was small. To me, video game is like a piece of art, a channel for developers to express themselves and a world for players to enjoy themselves. Each game I played when I was small represented a different experience for me.</p>
		<p>NeoPets gave me my first pets which always smiled at me despite the fact that I always forgot to feed them. Platform Racing gave me the tools to express my creativity by creating different maps in the game.</p>
		<p>DragonFable taught me that meaning of sacrificing oneself to fight the almight dragon of death in order to save the thousands of lives of the village. Just kidding, I'll be respawned if I get killed by the dragon.</p>
		<p>Runescape was the game that opened my eyes when I realised it's definitely possible to create a virtual world as big as the real world, with thousands of players online at the same time, thousands of NPCs and monsters that "live" in the world, hundreds of places to explore and a lot of skills (e.g. mining, crafting) to learn.</p>
		<p>There are also numerous games that I really love such as Realm of the Mad God and League of Legends, but I'll leave their stories for another time.<p>
