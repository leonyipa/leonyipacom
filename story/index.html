	<h1>My Gaming Childhood</h1>
	<span>"A gamer nerd was born."</span>
	<div class="containerArticleDiv">
		<p>I love building things. building things with lego bricks has been a thing for me since I was a child. I love drawing, so it is not uncommon to hear my mum shouting "stop drawing on the walls at home" or my teacher saying "next time maybe double-check your answers instead of scribbling on the back of the exam paper if you have extra time".</p>
		<p>I love playing video games since I was small. To me, video game is like a piece of art, a channel for developers to express themselves and a world for players to enjoy themselves. Each game I played when I was small represented a different experience for me.</p>
		<p>There are numerous games that I really love, such as Runescape, Realm of the Mad God and League of Legends, but I'll leave their stories for another time.<p>
	</div>
	
	<h1>Game Development</h1>
	<span>"Stumbling into the realm of creativity."</span>
	<div class="containerArticleDiv">
		<p>As much as I enjoy playing games, I have always wanted to develop a game of my own, where I can design everything from scratch, from each grass on the ground, to the cheerful pet that a player would feel happy to own, to the almighty final boss with dragon form awaiting to be defeated.</p>
		<p>War of The Gum Balls is the first game I developed, a side-scroller shooter built where players shoot bullets at monsters. At that time I have very limited programming knowledge and I was 17 years old, so I guess it's great work!</p>
		<p>Shootz.io is the first online multiplayer game I developed when I have some programming background when studying Computer Science in HKU. I've always wanted to develop an online game, where players can play with each other, since I'm also a great fan of MMORPGs.</p>
		<p>It's also the first .io game I have created because I'm also a huge fan of Agar.io and Slither.io. I like how the .io games trend is developed, a team of a few persons (or solo) can build games as popular as Agar.io with thousands (if not millions) of players and compete with high-quality games published by big companies.</p>
		<p>Over the next 4 years, I have continued to develop games, with monthly active players hitting 1 million, and YouTube views reaching 10 millions and sales reaching 7-figures. Some of my most popular games are: Fightz.io, Swordz.io, GunWars.io, Throwz.io...</p>

	<h1>Value Investing</h1>
	<span>"Venturing into the numbers game."</span>
	<div class="containerArticleDiv">
		<p>According to Albert Einstein, compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. An interesting example to prove this is if I were to offer you the choice between an immediate cash payment of one million dollars or a magic penny that doubled every day for 30 days, which one would you take? Most people might jump onto the million dollar deal at first glance, but if you do some simple maths you will be amazed that your penny would be worth over 5 million after 30 days.</p>
		<p>Apart from my passion in game development, I have also discovered my interest in data analysis and equity research in financial markets. I enjoy developing models, analysing data, and predicting the future.</p>
		<p>Value investing is also a game of long-term strategy, just like how you assign your troops for different duties as a commander. Capital needs to be allocated effectively and earn money for you. Invest in good businesses for a long time, and they will compound your wealth for you.</p>
		<p>Warren Buffett has managed to achieve annual investment returns of 20% for 50 years, which means an initial $1,000 investment would become $9,100,000 after 50 years. He is a great teacher with great books and interviews on investing in the future. Similar to other competitive gamers, nothing is more fun than learning from your idol and trying to be as good as him in the game, right?</p>
		<p>Some of the books that shaped my investment strategies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Intelligent Investors - Benjamin Graham</li>
			<li>The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America - Warren Buffett</li>
			<li>Poor Charlieâ€™s Almanack - Charlie Munger</li>
			<li>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing - John Bogle</li>
			<li>Mastering The Market Cycle - Howard Marks</li>
			<li>Invent and Wander - Jeff Bezos</li>
			<li>Principles - Ray Dalio</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Over the next 3 years, I managed to double the original money I earned from games. Some of the stocks in my portfolio are Alphabet, Meta, Alibaba and TSMC. Let's see if I'm able to double it again, and again.</p>

	<h1>Favourite Hobbies</h1>
	<span>"What I like to do during my freetime."</span>
	<div class="containerArticleDiv">
		<p>I like jogging, cycling and hiking, especially in places where I can have a glimpse of the sea, mountains or anything from Mother Nature.</p>
		<p>I like playing basketball too, even though I absolutely suck at those. And yes, I like Kobe Bryant and Jeremy Lin (And his spin moves).</p>
		<p>I also like listening to music, reading books and watching movies.</p>
